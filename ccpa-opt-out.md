To whom it may concern:

Any information I provide to you may be used solely
for the limited purpose of complying with the request
stated in this letter.

I opt out of the sale of my personal information.

I am a California resident.  My address is

{{CCPA_ADDRESS}}

My phone number is {{CCPA_PHONE}}.

According to the California Consumer Privacy Act
Regulations, published at

https://www.oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/privacy/oal-sub-final-text-of-regs.pdf

"A request to opt-out need not be a verifiable
consumer request."

You must act on this opt-out without requiring any
further action from me.

## If you choose not to act on this opt-out

According to Section 999.315(g) of the CCPA
regulations, you may only deny this request
if you provide a good-faith, reasonable, and
documented belief that this opt-out is fraudulent.
The regulations state, "If a business, however,
has a good-faith, reasonable, and documented belief
that a request to opt-out is fraudulent, the business
may deny the request.  The business shall inform the
requestor that it will not comply with the request
and shall provide an explanation why it believes the
request is fraudulent."

If you choose not to act on this opt-out, you must
provide me with an explanation of why you have
a good-faith, reasonable, and documented belief that
this opt-out is fraudulent.

## Transfer of my personal information to Facebook

Upon receipt of this opt-out, you are no longer
permitted, by law, or by Facebook policy, to use
my personal information for any Facebook Custom
Audience.  The CCPA defines "Sale" as selling,
renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making
available, transferring, or otherwise communicating
orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means,
a consumerâ€™s personal information by the business
to another business or a third party for monetary or
other valuable consideration.  According to Facebook's
Custom Audiences Terms, published at

https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/customaudience

"You represent and warrant that the Hashed Data
does not relate to data about any individual who
has exercised an option that you have, directly or
indirectly, committed to honoring or provided to
opt out of having that data disclosed and used for
targeted advertising. To the extent an individual
exercises such an opt-out after you have used data
relating to that individual to create a custom
audience, you will remove that data subject from the
custom audience."

Please reply to this request within 15 days by email to:

either to confirm that you have completed all
required action, or to provide an explanation of your
good-faith, reasonable, and documented belief that
this request is fraudulent.
