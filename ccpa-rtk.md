To whom it may concern:

Any information I provide to you may be used solely
for the limited purpose of complying with the request
stated in this letter.

This letter is in regard to your obligations under
the California Consumer Privacy Act.

My address is

{{ CCPA_ADDRESS }}

and my phone number is {{ CCPA_PHONE }}.

According to the California Consumer Privacy Act
Regulations, "If a consumer submits a request
in a manner that is not one of the designated
methods of submission, or is deficient in some
manner unrelated to the verification process,
the business shall either: (1) Treat the request
as if it had been submitted in accordance with the
businessâ€™s designated manner, or (2) Provide the
consumer with specific directions on how to submit the
request or remedy any deficiencies with the request,
if applicable."  If you choose the second option,
please provide the required directions.

I request that you disclose to me the categories
and specific pieces of personal information that your
company has collected about me, as required under
the CCPA.

I await your prompt response.

Sincerely,
