To whom it may concern:

Any information I provide to you may be used solely
for the limited purpose of complying with the request
stated in this letter.  My email address is {{ CCPA_EMAIL }}.

This letter is in regard to your obligations under
the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).

According to the California Consumer Privacy Act
Regulations, "If a consumer submits a request
in a manner that is not one of the designated
methods of submission, or is deficient in some
manner unrelated to the verification process,
the business shall either: (1) Treat the request
as if it had been submitted in accordance with the
businessâ€™s designated manner, or (2) Provide the
consumer with specific directions on how to submit the
request or remedy any deficiencies with the request,
if applicable."  If you choose the second option,
please provide the required directions.

I am exercising my right to opt out of the sale of
my personal information.

I request that you disclose to me the categories
and specific pieces of personal information that your
company has collected about me.

I request that you delete any personal information
about me from your records, and that you require all
service providers who may have my personal information
to delete any personal information about me from their
records.

The CCPA regulations require your action within 15 business
days. I await your prompt response.
