Dear [whoever]

I am writing to exercise my right under Article 21.3 of the GDPR to object to any and all processing for direct marketing purposes of personal data relating to me.

This includes, but is not limited to:

 * Acquiring or generating personal data relating to me from any source

 * Associating, attributing or inferring any category, trait or demographic label with/to/from personal data relating to me from any source

 * Augmenting, matching, selecting, or creating any personal data relating to me from any source

 * Targeting me, or anyone else based on processing operations performed on personal data relating to me from any source-

-where the intent or objective of doing so is to design, create, select, designate, report on, analyse or otherwise contribute to direct marketing activities at any time; now or in future.

I require you to cease any such processing with immediate effect, and take the necessary steps to ensure the exclusion of personal data relating to me from any future processing operations for direct marketing purposes.

I look forward to your acknowledgement of this objection, and to receiving your assurances, along with corroborating evidence, that my objection has been complied with.

Yours etc
