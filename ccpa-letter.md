To whom it may concern:

Any information I provide to you may be used solely
for the limited purpose of complying with the request
stated in this letter.

This letter is in regard to your obligations under
the General Data Protection Regulation, the California
Consumer Privacy Act, and/or the Data Protection Act.

My address is

{{ CCPA_ADDRESS }}

and my phone number is {{ CCPA_PHONE }}.

According to the California Consumer Privacy Act
Regulations, "If a consumer submits a request
in a manner that is not one of the designated
methods of submission, or is deficient in some
manner unrelated to the verification process,
the business shall either: (1) Treat the request
as if it had been submitted in accordance with the
businessâ€™s designated manner, or (2) Provide the
consumer with specific directions on how to submit the
request or remedy any deficiencies with the request,
if applicable."  If you choose the second option,
please provide the required directions.

1. I am exercising my right to opt out of the sale of
my personal information under the California Consumer
Privacy Act (CCPA).

2. I request that you disclose to me the categories
and specific pieces of personal information that your
company has collected about me, as required under
the CCPA.

3. I request that you delete any personal information
about me from your records, and that you require all
service providers who may have my personal information
to delete any personal information about me from their
records.

4. I request confirmation as to whether or not
personal data concerning me are being processed by
your company, and, where that is the case, access
to the personal data and all information to which
I have a right under Article 15 of the General
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

5. I object to the processing of my personal data
for direct marketing, including any profiling of
data related to direct marketing, under Article 21
of the GDPR.

6. I request confirmation as to whether your company
hold personal data on me, and I request access to that
data as required by section 17 of the Data Protection
Act (DPA).

7. I object to the processing of my personal
data, under section 32 of the DPA.

If you choose not to respond to any of the items
above because, in your opinion, the GDPR, CCPA or
DPA does not apply, please respond to all requests
that do apply.  I await your prompt response.

Sincerely,

{{ CCPA_NAME }}
