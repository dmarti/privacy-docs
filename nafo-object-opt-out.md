To whom it may concern:

Any information I provide to you may be used solely for the limited purpose of performing the actions required of you by this letter.

I am exercising my right under Article 21.3 of the General Data Protection Regulation to object to any and all processing for direct marketing purposes of personal data relating to me.

I require you to cease any such processing with immediate effect, and take the necessary steps to ensure the exclusion of personal data relating to me from any future processing operations for direct marketing purposes.

In addition, I opt out of the sale of my personal information.  My address is

{{CCPA_ADDRESS}}

My phone number is {{CCPA_PHONE}}.

According to the California Consumer Privacy Act Regulations, published at

https://www.oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/privacy/oal-sub-final-text-of-regs.pdf

you may only deny this opt-out if you provide a good-faith, reasonable, and documented belief that it is fraudulent.  The regulations state, "If a business, however, has a good-faith, reasonable, and documented belief that a request to opt-out is fraudulent, the business may deny the request.  The business shall inform the requestor that it will not comply with the request and shall provide an explanation why it believes the request is fraudulent."

If you choose not to act on this opt-out, you must provide me with an explanation of why you have a good-faith, reasonable, and documented belief that this opt-out is fraudulent.

I look forward to your prompt acknowledgement of this letter, and to receiving your assurances, along with corroborating evidence, that it has been complied with.

A copy of this letter will be made available to relevant privacy and sanctions enforcement offices in relevant jurisdictions, and to the NAFO Data Protection Secretariat.


Thank you for your help.

Sincerely,

{{CCPA_NAME}}
